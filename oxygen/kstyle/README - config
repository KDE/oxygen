[Style]
# controls the way the huge bg pixmaps (BackgroundMode=3) are created
# 0: No acceleration, the pixmap is fetched from a daemon "oxygenPP" that MUST be running if you wanna use this (maybe removed)
# 1: the QGradient classes are used (afaics pure software) - slow
# 2: XRender, *use this*, currently the fastest and in matters of color best adjusted function
# 3: OpenGL, currently too dark - slow as long as we don't have HW for gl_ext_pixmap_from_texture...
Acceleration=2

# the background appereance
# 0: plain color
# 1: the beloved scanlines - don't argue, they'll stay ;)
# 2: [reserved]
# 3: complex lights (i.e. huge pixmap with several gradients, see above)
# 4: Simple gradient that brightens on the upper and darkens on the lower end (fallback suggestion 1, alphablending can be cached)
# 5: Simple gradient that darkens on left and right side
# 6: The window vertically brightens to the center
# 7: The window horizontally brightens to the center (like Apples Brushed Metal, fallback suggestion 2, requires realtime alphablending)
